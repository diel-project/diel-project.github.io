Welcome to the official website of the Global Animal Diel Activity Project. 

# Project context

The diel activity (activity over the 24-hour period of time) of organisms is typically described using the terms diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular or cathemeral. The species that are active primarily during the day are considered **diurnal** while those that are active predominantly at night time are taken as **nocturnal**. **Crepuscular** species are active at dawn and dusk while **cathemeral** creatures are active for irregular periods through the 24-hour period. Activity patterns are shaped by the morphology, physiology, and phylogeny of species.

In this project, we are estimating mammal diel activity across the globe in a rigorous and comparable framework. We are specifically focused on non-volant mammals that are detectable via camera traps.
