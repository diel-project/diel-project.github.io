As part of this project, we are working on: 

1) providing the first empirically-based estimates of diel activity and plasticity for a global distribution of species that will be compared against traditional definitions and classifications. 

2) implementing a resource selection framework to estimate temporal use and selection resulting in a more holistic understanding of species temporal activity with a more synthetic empirically-based categorization of diel activity of mammals that simultaneously includes the concepts of use, selection, and plasticity.

3) developing an understanding of speciesâ€™ plasticity in temporal use and selection by considering both environmental and anthropogenic factors.

Stay tuned for more!
